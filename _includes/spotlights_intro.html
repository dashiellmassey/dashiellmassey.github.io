            <h2> Promoting Black biologists and science literacy </h2>
    
    <p> In the past few years, I have built a collection of "spotlights" on Black faculty in STEM.
    Each spotlight features the work of a Black scientist (including discussion of a primary research article), aimed at a lay audience. I
    originally posted these on Facebook, one each day throughout the month of February. My goals in writing these profiles was to:
    
    <ul>
    <li> promote the work of these researchers,</li>
    <li> engage non-experts in thinking about (and getting excited about) biology, and </li>
    <li> challenge preconceived notions about what a scientist "looks like" </li>
    </ul>

   <p><i> If you are featured and would like to make an addition/correction (or if you would like me to take down your profile), please
    <a class="light-bg" href="mailto:dashiell.massey.web@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">let me know</a>!
     If you are a Black scientist who I have not written about and you would like to be featured in a future February, I would love to hear
     from you.</i>
