<h2> Social networks and the "hidden curriculum" </h2>

<p> A throughline across the various diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that I have participated in is my longstanding
interest in how socially-segregated interpersonal networks create persistent barriers to equity, even when institutions have the best of intentions. In other words: <b> how much of the "hidden curriculum" of academic success is learned from friends rather than through formal 
  programming? </b></p>
  
<p> This interest dates back to high school: I grew up in Cambridge, MA, which spends more per student than any other urban district in 
  the state, and my high school had roughly equal proportions of white and Black students (each ~35%). Students were not "tracked" into
  college preparation, honors, and AP courses, but rather given the opportunity to enroll in any level for any given course. Yet honors
  and AP classes were disproportionately white.</p>
  
<p> Struck by this discrepancy, I proposed a project to the Mayorâ€™s Office and School District, which generously provided me with funding
  to mail a survey to every family at the high school. In the 200 parent-student pairs who responded, I found that parents and students
  alike expressed confusion about selecting the appropriate level of course difficulty and that the majority reported that they made 
  these decisions primarily based on information from friends and peers, rather than from school administrators. </p>
  
<p> This idea has informed the way that I approach <a href="/teaching/">teaching</a>, and it has shaped the efforts that I have 
  contributed to as a core member of my department's <a href="https://www.cornellmbgdiversity.org/ target="_blank" 
    rel="noopener noreferrer"> Diversity Council</a>:
    
    <ul>
    
    <li> I developed an <a href="https://gendev.cornell.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Preparing-for-the-A-Exam.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"informal guide"</a> to writing the candidacy exam, which collected the type of advice that
    students receive from more senior friends in one place, accessible to everyone.</li>
    
    <br>
    
    <li> I spearheared the creation of a department-specific
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tDdShkEMDvK7N0GymT6Vmf_h-PZZpIykeBYyGE3FBZI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" 
    rel="noopener noreferrer">DEI Resource Guide</a>, which has been shared across the university.</li>
    
    <br>
    
    <li> Together with graduate students from four other graduate programs, I helped organize the first
    <a href="https://www.lifescidrw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Life Sciences Diversity Recruitment Weekend </a>, 
    a two-day virtual event to share information about writing stronger Ph.D. applications with anyone (worldwide) from a background 
    historically underrepresented in academia.</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h2> Promoting Black biologists and science literacy </h2>
    
    <p> Over the past few years, I have been building a collection of "spotlights" on Black faculty, which I post on daily on Facebook
    throughout the month of February. Each spotlight features the work of a Black biologist (incluing discussion of a primary research
    article), aimed at a lay audience. My goals in writing these profiles are to:
    
    <ul>
    <li> promote the work of these researchers,</li>
    <li> engage non-experts in thinking about (and getting excited about) biology, and </li>
    <li> challenge preconceived notions about a scientist "looks like" </li>
    </ul>
