<h2> Social networks and the "hidden curriculum" </h2>

<p> A through line across the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that I have participated in is my longstanding
interest in how socially-segregated interpersonal networks create persistent barriers to equity, even when institutions have the best of intentions. In other words:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <b> How much of the "hidden curriculum" of academia is learned from friends, and not from formal programming?</b>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <b>And if <i>what</i> we know depends on <i>who</i> we know, how do we level the playing field?</b>
</p>
  
<p> This interest dates back to high school: my high school had roughly equal numbers of white and Black students, and gave each student
  the choice of whether to take any course at the college preparation, honors, and AP level; yet honors and AP classes were 
  disproportionately white. In the summer my junior year of high school, I proposed a project to the Mayorâ€™s Office and School District, 
  which generously provided me with funding to mail a survey to every family at the school. In the ~200 parent-student pairs who responded,
  the majority of parents and students alike reported that they made these decisions primarily based on information from friends and peers,
  rather than from school administrators. </p>
  
<p> In the subsequent 12+ years, I have consistently seen this pattern play out: inequitable access to <i>information</i> shapes inequitable
  outcomes, even when efforts are made to create equitable policies.
</p>

<p> Thus, in my work with my department's 
  <a href="https://www.cornellmbgdiversity.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Diversity Council</a>, 
  I have focused my efforts on helping to generate resources that make explicit and available to everyone the "informal" advice typically
  shared by more senior friends or lab members. These projects have included:
                                                                                                               
    <ul>
    
    <li> an <a href="https://gendev.cornell.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Preparing-for-the-A-Exam.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"informal guide"</a> to writing the candidacy exam, with advice on time management, how to get support, etc.</li>    
    <li> a department-specific
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tDdShkEMDvK7N0GymT6Vmf_h-PZZpIykeBYyGE3FBZI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" 
    rel="noopener noreferrer">DEI Resource Guide</a>, which has been shared across the university</li>
    <li> the first
    <a href="https://www.lifescidrw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Life Sciences Diversity Recruitment Weekend </a>, 
    a two-day virtual event to share information about writing stronger Ph.D. applications with anyone (worldwide) from a background 
    historically underrepresented in academia, co-sponsored by five graduate programs</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h2> Promoting Black biologists and science literacy </h2>
    
    <p> Over the past few years, I have been building a collection of "spotlights" on Black faculty, which I post on daily on Facebook
    throughout the month of February. Each spotlight features the work of a Black biologist (including discussion of a primary research
    article), aimed at a lay audience. My goals in writing these profiles are to:
    
    <ul>
    <li> promote the work of these researchers,</li>
    <li> engage non-experts in thinking about (and getting excited about) biology, and </li>
    <li> challenge preconceived notions about a scientist "looks like" </li>
    </ul>
    
<p> Check out the profiles from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dashiell.massey/media_set?set=a.10155110580103606&type=3"

     If you are a Black scientist who I have not written about and you would like to be featured in a future February, I would love to hear
     from you.</i>
