title: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

<p> A throughline across the various diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that I have participated in is my longstanding
interest in how socially-segregated interpersonal networks create persistent barriers to equity, even when institutions have the best of intentions. In other words: <b> how much of the "hidden curriculum" of academic success is learned from friends rather than through formal 
  programming? </b></p>
  
<p> This interest dates back to high school: I grew up in Cambridge, MA, which spends more per student than any other urban district in 
  the state, and my high school had roughly equal proportions of white and Black students (each ~35%). Students were not "tracked" into
  college preparation, honors, and AP courses, but rather given the opportunity to enroll in any level for any given course. Yet honors
  and AP classes were disproportionately white.</p>
  
<p> Struck by this discrepancy, I proposed a project to the Mayorâ€™s Office and School District, which generously provided me with funding
  to mail a survey to every family at the high school. In the 200 parent-student pairs who responded, I found that parents and students
  alike expressed confusion about selecting the appropriate level of course difficulty and that the majority reported that they made 
  these decisions primarily based on information from friends and peers, rather than from school administrators. </p>
