I have 10 semesters of experience teaching undergraduate biology labs, first as an undergraduate Teaching Assistant, then as a laboratory
coordinator, and currently as a graduate Teaching Assistant. These experiences are described below.

<p> In 2021, I was a recipient of the <b>Outstanding Graduate Teaching Assistant</b> award from the Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.

<h2> Cornell University </h2>
<h3> BIOMG 2801, Undergraduate Lab in Genetics and Genomics (2018, 2019, 2020)</h3>

<p> BIOMG 2801, a stand-alone lab course, is a required course for the undergraduate biology major. The student population is primarily 
  juniors and seniors. As a TA, my responsibilities included:
  
  <ul>
    <li> teaching lab sections of 18-20 students </li>
    <li> grading assignments, lab reports, and exams </li>
    <li> holding weekly office hours </li>
  </ul>
  
<p> In the four semesters that I have been a TA for this course, I have taken on additoinal leadership roles, involving:
  
  <ul>
    <li> participating in proofreading new assignment and exam questions during a large curricular overhaul</li>
    <li> piloting an all-virtual summer session in preparation for the Fall 2020 semester</li>
    <li> co-leading weekly TA meetings, and</li>
    <li> developing grading rubrics for student work</li>
  </ul>

<h2> Cornell Scholarship of Teaching and Learning program </h2>
  
<p> In the 2019-2020 academic year, I participated in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning program at Cornell, an incredible opportunity
  for graduate students to develop pedagogy-related research projects related to their TA experiences.
  
<p> The undergraduate genetics lab is one of very few courses required for all undergraduate biology majors at Cornell. As a result, the
  students come into the classroom with heterogeneous levels of comfort and familiarity with molecular biology. My experiences as a TA made
  me curious about why this particular course is required, given the general flexibility of the biology major. My pedagogy project, advised
  by Dr. Kimberly Williams, drew on newspaper articles and task force reports to reconstruct the history of the undergraduate biology major
  requirements at Cornell. At the same time, I interviewed a current student and a faculty member about how they conceived of the major. 
  I found that although the current major requirements ostensibly implemented the curricular redesign proposed in 2008, there is a
  discrepancy between how the Undergraduate Biology Curriculum Task Force envisioned the new major and how it is perceived today. I
  presented this work at the Mini-Symposium on Connecting Research and Teaching in May 2020. Link to slides. Link to abstract.

<h2> Laboratory Coordinator at Georgetown University </h2>
  
<p> Between college and graduate school, I worked full-time at Georgetown University, supporting laboratory instruction in the Department
  of Human Science. I coordinated all lab sections for the anatomy and physiology, genetics, microbiology, and cell biology courses, which
  involved ~20 hours per week in the teaching lab with students – demonstrating techniques, answering questions, encouraging conversations
  within lab groups – as well as preparing teaching materials, overseeing TAs, and doing all of the behind-the-scenes technical
  preparations. When not supporting classroom teaching, I was responsible for managing the shared research lab of six faculty members,
  which often entailed helping their undergraduate research students run experiments or analyze results.

<h2> Writing Associate and Teaching Assistant at Swarthmore College </h2>

<p> As an undergraduate, I was recruited as Writing Associate (WA) and trained in a semester-long course in writing pedagogy. For 3 years, I
  worked as a "Course WA" for the introductory biology courses, assigned 10-12 students each semester. Throughout the semester, I worked
  one-on-one with these students to mentor them through the process of writing lab reports. In my senior year, I was also a Teaching
  Assistant for these same two introductory biology labs.
  
 <p> In my 3 years as a WA, I also worked in the Writing Center, where I worked with students at all levels on discipline-specific writing
   practices across all disciplines, and served as a peer mentor to a total of five WAs-in-training.
