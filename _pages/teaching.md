I have 10 semesters of experience teaching undergraduate biology labs, first as an undergraduate Teaching Assistant, then as a laboratory
coordinator, and currently as a graduate Teaching Assistant. These experiences are described below.

<h2> Cornell University </h2>

<p> In 2021, I was a recipient of the <b>Outstanding Graduate Teaching Assistant</b> award from the Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.

<h3> BIOMG 2801, Undergraduate Lab in Genetics and Genomics (2018, 2019, 2020)</h3>

<p> BIOMG 2801, a stand-alone lab course, is a required course for the undergraduate biology major. The student population is primarily 
  juniors and seniors. As a TA, my responsibilities included:
  
  <ul>
    <li> teaching lab sections of 18-20 students </li>
    <li> grading assignments, lab reports, and exams </li>
    <li> supervising undergraduate Teaching Assistants </li>
    <li> holding weekly office hours </li>
  </ul>
  
<p> In the four semesters that I have been a TA for this course, I have taken on additional leadership roles, involving:
  
  <ul>
    <li> participating in proofreading new assignment and exam questions during a large curricular overhaul</li>
    <li> piloting an all-virtual summer session in preparation for the Fall 2020 semester</li>
    <li> co-leading weekly TA meetings, and</li>
    <li> developing grading rubrics for student work</li>
  </ul>

<h3> Scholarship of Teaching and Learning program (2019-2020)</h3>
  
<p> BIOMG 2801 is one of very few required courses for the undergraduate biology major. Curious about why this is the case, I designed and 
  implemented a research project as part of the <a class="light-bg" href="https://futurefaculty.cornell.edu/programs/local-programs/scholarship-of-teaching-
  and-learning-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scholarship of Teaching and Learning program</a>. My project, advised
  by <a class="light-bg" href="https://www.educationalsolutionscny.com/dr-kimberly-williams.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Kimberly 
  Williams</a>, drew on newspaper articles and task force reports to reconstruct the history of the undergraduate biology major
  requirements at Cornell. I also interviewed a current student and a faculty member about how they conceived of the major.

<p> I found that although the current major requirements ostensibly implemented the curricular redesign proposed in 2008, there is a
  discrepancy between how this curriculum was envisioned and how it is understood by students and faculty alike. I
  presented this work at the <a class="light-bg" href="https://futurefaculty.cornell.edu/community/participants/sotl-practitioners/" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer">Mini-Symposium on Connecting Research and Teaching</a> in May 2020.

<h2> Georgetown University </h2>
<h3> Laboratory Coordinator (2014-2016) </h3>
  
<p> As the laboratory coordinator for the <a class="light-bg" href="https://nhs.georgetown.edu/research-learning-community/discovery-center/" 
                                             target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery Center</a> in the
  <a class="light-bg" href="https://nhs.georgetown.edu/about/human-science-department/" 
                                             target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Human Science</a>,
  I supported laboratory instruction for the anatomy and physiology, genetics, microbiology, and cell biology courses. This entailed:
  
  <ul>
    <li> preparing teaching materials (both documents and technical preparations)</li>
    <li> supervising undergraduate and medical student Teaching Assistants</li>
    <li> serving as instructional support for 5-7 three-hour labs per week</li>
  </ul>
  
  When not supporting classroom teaching, I was also responsible for the shared research lab of six faculty members, including
  ordering and budgeting, ensuring EH&S compliance, lab upkeep, and monitoring the ~20 undergraduate research students using the space.

<h2> Swarthmore College </h2>

<h3> Teaching Assistant (2013-2014) </h3>
<p> As an undergraduate, I was a Teaching Assistant for the laboratory components of the two introductory biology courses: Cellular and Molecular Biology (BIOL 001) and Organismal and Population Biology (BIOL 002). This involved hands-on assistance during the lab period, as 
  well as running extra statistical help sessions.
  
<hr style="height:1px; border:none; color:#4A1486; background-color:#4A1486;">

<h3> Writing Associate (2011-2014) </h3>
<p> I was recruited to participate in the <a class="light-bg" href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/writing/writing-associate-fellows" 
                          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Writing Associate (WA) Fellowship program</a>, 
  and trained in a semester-long course in writing pedagogy. For 3 years, I worked as a
  <a class="light-bg" href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/writing/course-wa-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Course WA"</a> for the 
  introductory biology courses, assigned 10-12 students each semester. Throughout the semester, I worked one-on-one with these students 
  to mentor them through the process of writing lab reports.
  
 <p> In my 3 years as a WA, I also worked in the Swarthmore College Writing Center, where I helped students at all levels on 
   discipline-specific writing practices across all disciplines, and served as a peer mentor to a total of five WAs-in-training.
