I have 10 semesters of experience teaching undergraduate biology labs, first as an undergraduate Teaching Assistant, then as a laboratory
coordinator, and currently as a graduate Teaching Assistant. These experiences are described below.

<h2> Cornell University </h2>

<p> In 2021, I was a recipient of the <b>Outstanding Graduate Teaching Assistant</b> award from the Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.

<h3> BIOMG 2801, Undergraduate Lab in Genetics and Genomics (2018, 2019, 2020)</h3>

<p> BIOMG 2801, a stand-alone lab course, is a required course for the undergraduate biology major. The student population is primarily 
  juniors and seniors. As a TA, my responsibilities included:
  
  <ul>
    <li> teaching lab sections of 18-20 students </li>
    <li> grading assignments, lab reports, and exams </li>
    <li> holding weekly office hours </li>
  </ul>
  
<p> In the four semesters that I have been a TA for this course, I have taken on additoinal leadership roles, involving:
  
  <ul>
    <li> participating in proofreading new assignment and exam questions during a large curricular overhaul</li>
    <li> piloting an all-virtual summer session in preparation for the Fall 2020 semester</li>
    <li> co-leading weekly TA meetings, and</li>
    <li> developing grading rubrics for student work</li>
  </ul>

<h3> Scholarship of Teaching and Learning program (2019-2020)</h3>
  
<p> BIOMG 2801 is one of very few required courses for the undergraduate biology major. Curious about why this is the case, I designed and 
  implemented a research project as part of the <a href="https://futurefaculty.cornell.edu/programs/local-programs/scholarship-of-teaching-
  and-learning-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scholarship of Teaching and Learning program</a>. My project, advised
  by <a href="https://www.educationalsolutionscny.com/dr-kimberly-williams.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Kimberly 
  Williams</a>, drew on newspaper articles and task force reports to reconstruct the history of the undergraduate biology major
  requirements at Cornell. I also interviewed a current student and a faculty member about how they conceived of the major.

<p> I found that although the current major requirements ostensibly implemented the curricular redesign proposed in 2008, there is a
  discrepancy between how this curriculum was envisioned and how it is understood by students and faculty alike. I
  presented this work at the <a href="https://futurefaculty.cornell.edu/community/participants/sotl-practitioners/" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer">Mini-Symposium on Connecting Research and Teaching</a> in May 2020.

<h2> Georgetown University </h2>
<h3> Laboratory Coordinator </h3>
  
<p> Between college and graduate school, I worked full-time at Georgetown University, supporting laboratory instruction in the Department
  of Human Science. I coordinated all lab sections for the anatomy and physiology, genetics, microbiology, and cell biology courses, which
  involved ~20 hours per week in the teaching lab with students – demonstrating techniques, answering questions, encouraging conversations
  within lab groups – as well as preparing teaching materials, overseeing TAs, and doing all of the behind-the-scenes technical
  preparations. When not supporting classroom teaching, I was responsible for managing the shared research lab of six faculty members,
  which often entailed helping their undergraduate research students run experiments or analyze results.

<h2> Writing Associate and Teaching Assistant at Swarthmore College </h2>

<p> As an undergraduate, I was recruited as Writing Associate (WA) and trained in a semester-long course in writing pedagogy. For 3 years, I
  worked as a "Course WA" for the introductory biology courses, assigned 10-12 students each semester. Throughout the semester, I worked
  one-on-one with these students to mentor them through the process of writing lab reports. In my senior year, I was also a Teaching
  Assistant for these same two introductory biology labs.
  
 <p> In my 3 years as a WA, I also worked in the Writing Center, where I worked with students at all levels on discipline-specific writing
   practices across all disciplines, and served as a peer mentor to a total of five WAs-in-training.
