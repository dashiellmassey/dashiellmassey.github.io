I have 10 semesters of experience teaching undergraduate biology labs, first as an undergraduate Teaching Assistant, then as a laboratory
coordinator, and currently as a graduate Teaching Assistant. Read about my philosophy on teaching

<h2> Cornell Undergraduate Lab in Genetics and Genomics </h2>

<p> I have been a Teaching Assistant for BIOMG 2801, the undergraduate Laboratory in Genetics and Genomics, four times. This role has 
  entailed teaching lab sections of 18-20 students; grading assignments, lab reports, and exams; and holding weekly office hours. I have
  received excellent teaching evaluations from students, and have served as a leader in weekly TA meetings, developing rubrics to improve
  consistency in grading between TAs – a challenge in a course with eight graduate student TAs.

<p> During this time, I have assisted in two major transitions in the BIOMG 2801 course. First, the entire curriculum was redesigned in
  2018, replacing a series of one-off lab exercises with a set of three interconnected semester-long projects. In Spring 2019, I was part
  of the first cohort of TAs to participate in the rollout of this new curriculum. Although the new curriculum had been tested out on ~20
  students (and a single TA) prior to this, there were numerous challenges associated with translating that to a course of ~150 students
  with multiple TAs. I was heavily involved in proofreading new assignment and exam questions, and in sorting out logistical challenges 
  that came with scaling up the new labs in real time.

<p> Second, we were forced to transition the course to an online format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As you can imagine, moving a
  hands-on lab course to Zoom required not only the development of new course materials, but also a broader rethinking of content delivery.
  I worked closely with Dr. Kristina Blake to implement this new version during the Summer 2020 term, when there were only 19 students
  enrolled. Then, in the Fall 2020 semester, I helped lead the adoption of this online-only version of the course, when we had 8 graduate
  TAs (including me), 16 undergraduate TAs, and ~150 students.

<h2> Cornell Scholarship of Teaching and Learning program </h2>
  
<p> In the 2019-2020 academic year, I participated in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning program at Cornell, an incredible opportunity
  for graduate students to develop pedagogy-related research projects related to their TA experiences.
  
<p> The undergraduate genetics lab is one of very few courses required for all undergraduate biology majors at Cornell. As a result, the
  students come into the classroom with heterogeneous levels of comfort and familiarity with molecular biology. My experiences as a TA made
  me curious about why this particular course is required, given the general flexibility of the biology major. My pedagogy project, advised
  by Dr. Kimberly Williams, drew on newspaper articles and task force reports to reconstruct the history of the undergraduate biology major
  requirements at Cornell. At the same time, I interviewed a current student and a faculty member about how they conceived of the major. 
  I found that although the current major requirements ostensibly implemented the curricular redesign proposed in 2008, there is a
  discrepancy between how the Undergraduate Biology Curriculum Task Force envisioned the new major and how it is perceived today. I
  presented this work at the Mini-Symposium on Connecting Research and Teaching in May 2020. Link to slides. Link to abstract.

<h2> Laboratory Coordinator at Georgetown University </h2>
  
<p> Between college and graduate school, I worked full-time at Georgetown University, supporting laboratory instruction in the Department
  of Human Science. I coordinated all lab sections for the anatomy and physiology, genetics, microbiology, and cell biology courses, which
  involved ~20 hours per week in the teaching lab with students – demonstrating techniques, answering questions, encouraging conversations
  within lab groups – as well as preparing teaching materials, overseeing TAs, and doing all of the behind-the-scenes technical
  preparations. When not supporting classroom teaching, I was responsible for managing the shared research lab of six faculty members,
  which often entailed helping their undergraduate research students run experiments or analyze results.

<h2> Writing Associate and Teaching Assistant at Swarthmore College </h2>

<p> As an undergraduate, I was recruited as Writing Associate (WA) and trained in a semester-long course in writing pedagogy. For 3 years, I
  worked as a "Course WA" for the introductory biology courses, assigned 10-12 students each semester. Throughout the semester, I worked
  one-on-one with these students to mentor them through the process of writing lab reports. In my senior year, I was also a Teaching
  Assistant for these same two introductory biology labs.
  
 <p> In my 3 years as a WA, I also worked in the Writing Center, where I worked with students at all levels on discipline-specific writing
   practices across all disciplines, and served as a peer mentor to a total of five WAs-in-training.
