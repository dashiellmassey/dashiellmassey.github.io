<br>
I grew up in Cambridge, MA, and received a B.A. in Biology from <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College</a>, a small liberal arts college in Pennsylvania. During my time as an undergraduate, I conducted research under the mentorship of Dr. Catherine Allan, MD, a pediatric cardiac intensivist at <a href="childrenshospital">Boston Children's Hospital</a>, investigating predictors of negative outcomes following a specific neonatal surgical procedure (delayed sternal re-approximation).

<br>
After graduation, I worked for two years as a laboratory coordinator in the <a href="https://nhs.georgetown.edu/about/human-science-department/">Department of Human Biology</a> at Georgetown University. In that capacity, I was responsible for preparing materials, supervising undergraduate Teaching Assistants, and helping to teach the anatomy & physiology, microbiology, genetics, and cell biology lab courses (5-7 three-hour labs per week). I was also the shared lab manager for four faculty members, overseeing a lab space shared by ~20 undergraduate research students in any given semester. During this time, I worked with <a href="https://blogs.commons.georgetown.edu/janlarocque/">Dr. Jan LaRocque, PhD</a>, to study the effects of aging on DNA repair in the fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>.
