I grew up in Cambridge, MA, and received a B.A. in Biology from <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College</a>, a small liberal arts college in Pennsylvania. During my time as an undergraduate, I conducted research under the mentorship of Dr. Catherine Allan, MD, a pediatric cardiac intensivist at <a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/">Boston Children's Hospital</a>, investigating predictors of negative outcomes following a specific neonatal surgical procedure (delayed sternal re-approximation).
<br>
<br>
After graduation, I worked for two years as a laboratory coordinator in the <a href="https://nhs.georgetown.edu/about/human-science-department/">Department of Human Biology</a> at Georgetown University. In that capacity, I was responsible for preparing materials, supervising undergraduate Teaching Assistants, and helping to teach the anatomy & physiology, microbiology, genetics, and cell biology lab courses (5-7 three-hour labs per week). I was also the shared lab manager for four faculty members, overseeing a lab space shared by ~20 undergraduate research students in any given semester. During this time, I worked with <a href="https://blogs.commons.georgetown.edu/janlarocque/">Dr. Jan LaRocque, PhD</a>, to study the effects of aging on DNA repair in the fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate in Dr. Amnon Koren's lab, in the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at Cornell University.
The Koren Lab studies DNA replication timing, the spatiotemporal ordering in which genomic regions are replicated during S phase. My research focuses on developing a method to study replication timing of individual cells, in order to study how it might vary between cells.
