                About Me
            </h2><hr>
            Hi, I'm Dashiell! I'm a computational biologist interested in developing new methods for understanding complex
            biological processes that vary in space and time. I'm particuarly interested in how we can better account for the fact that
            we are likely to undersample the true extent of variation.

            I am currently a postdoctoral associate with <a class="light-bg" href="https://www.goldberglab.org/"

            Department of Evolutionary Anthropology</a> at Duke University, where I study assortative mating and admixture in humans
            using forward-in-time population genetic simulations. Read about this work in <a class="light-bg"

            I received my Ph.D. in 2022 in the lab of <a class="light-bg" href="https://www.thekorenlab.org/" 
                                                              target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Amnon Koren</a>

            Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics</a> at Cornell University,
            where I was a student in the <a class="light-bg" href="https://www.gendev.cornell.edu/"

            <br>
            In the Koren lab, I studied <b>human DNA replication timing</b>. My dissertation focused on uncovering heterogeneity
            in replication timing at the single-cell level, in order to better understand
            its regulation. This work was published <a class="light-bg"

            <br>
            In addition to my research interests, I am passionate about <b>teaching</b>, <b>science literacy</b>, and 
            <b>promoting equity in STEM</b> &#8212;
            goals that I see as deeply intertwined with one another (and with my research interests).
