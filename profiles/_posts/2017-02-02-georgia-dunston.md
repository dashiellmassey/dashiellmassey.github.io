This is Dr. Georgia Dunston, founding director of the National Human Genome Center at Howard University. She was the first African-American student to earn a PhD in Human Genetics from the University of Michigan in 1972. After earning her PhD, she was recruited to Howard University in Washington DC, where she did post-doctoral work in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute.

——————————

DNA contains the instructions for growth and development of all known living organisms, including humans. Most of the time, it exists as two long strands wrapped around each other — you might have heard of it as the “double helix”, but I think picturing it as a ladder twisted around itself is helpful.

Each strand of this twisted ladder has the full set of instructions for a whole organism, written out in an alphabet of only four “letters”: the nucleotides adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Just like writing in English, the order (or “sequence”) of the nucleotides is what determines the message — usually we call these messages “genes”, and we call the full set of all the messages in an organism the “genome”.

In 1990, scientists from around the world started The Human Genome Project. The goal was to sequence the genome of a human and create a reference that scientists could use to answer questions like: how many genes are there? How much variation is there between humans? How much variation is there between humans and chimpanzees? Humans and mice?

However, the human population is not completely homogenous — there are distinct populations and those populations have intermixed to varying degrees at various times. Dr. Dunston fought hard for the inclusion of more diverse samples into the Human Genome Project, to better represent the overall human population.

Additionally, she founded the National Human Genome Center at Howard University in 2001. The NHGC collects and studies the genome sequences of African Americans and members of other African Diaspora communities, trying to better understand why certain health problems are more common in these communities and/or why certain health problems have different symptoms for different groups of people. (Her particular interest is asthma in African Americans.)

Her most recent paper (published in Nature Communications in October 2016) sequenced DNA from 642 people who identified as having African ancestry (from the US, Barbados, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico). A major goal of the study was to increase the diversity of genomes that we have available for study.

Additionally, they were able to estimate the amount of genetic variation that resulted from the African Diaspora and to draw some conclusions about the histories of various populations, based on how similar they were.

They also compared these genomes to pre-existing datasets of white Utahns, Yoruba people from Nigeria, and several indigenous groups in Mexico and Peru. From this, they were able to show that different populations had different percentages of European, African, and indigenous ancestry — and that European variants came mostly from male ancestors, while African and indigenous variants came mostly from female ancestors.
