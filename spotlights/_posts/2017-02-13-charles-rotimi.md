title: Dr. Charles Rotimi
headline: This is Dr. Charles Rotimi, Director of the Center for Research on Genomics and Global Health (CRGGH), an initiative that brings together researchers from different parts of the NIH to better understand how genetic and environmental factors come together to result in complex diseases, across the world’s populations.

Although “race” is not something that has ever been found to exist genetically, sequencing of DNA from people around the world has consistently shown non-random patterns of genetic history — people from one area will tend to have one particular combination of genetic variants, while people from another area will tend to have a different combination of variants. These geographic and genetic changes are associated with different susceptibilities to disease and different health risks, meaning that the better we can explain these connections, the better we can personalize medical efforts. At the same time, Dr. Rotimi and his collaborators at the CRGGH want to make sure that researchers and human subjects are engaged in two-way dialogue about what these findings about genetic history and ancestry mean about self and about group identity.

Dr. Rotimi is originally from Nigeria, and earned his bachelor’s degree in biochemistry at the University of Benin. He came to the United States in the early 1980s to continue his education, first earning a Master’s in Health Care Administration from the University of Mississippi, then both a Master’s of Public Health and a PhD in Epidemiology from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He was a professor at Howard University (and a director of the National Human Genome Center there, see Day 1) until 2008, when he joined the NIH’s National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).

Dr. Rotimi is also the head of the Metabolic, Cardiovascular, and Inflammatory Disease Genomics Branch of NHGRI. His lab studies the roles of culture, lifestyle, and genetics on disease — one major project is comparing the prevalence, symptoms, medication responses, etc. for obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and kidney disease for three groups: African Americans, Africans (from Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya) and China (Suizhou). He also started an initiative called Human Health and Heredity in Africa (H3Africa), which is working to build infrastructure for African scientists to participate as active collaborators in research, rather than just sample collectors. H3Africa works to train African scientists, helps secure funding for technological research resources, and is developing a network of collaboration among African scientists.
