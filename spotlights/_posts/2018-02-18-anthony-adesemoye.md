Dr. Adesemoye earned his PhD from Auburn University in 2009. He completed postdoctoral research in Dr. Akif Eskalen’s lab at UC Riverside. At Nebraska, he collaborates with Dr. Stephen Wegulo (who will be profiled later this month).

In the past decade, there has been an increase in the number of citrus trees infected with dry root rot in California. Infected trees lose most of the color in their leaves for several years, before wilting and dying. To date, no treatment has been found that can effectively save a tree — infected trees must be removed from the orchard and replaced with new saplings. There is one fungus that is often found in the roots of the dead trees, but it seems to cause disease only some of the time it is present. Thus, it is thought that this fungus may only be dangerous to the tree if it is already weakened by some other stress.

In recent paper, Dr. Adesemoye and colleagues looked at another fungus, Neonectria macrodidyma, because it has been shown to cause black foot disease in several other fruit crops. This fungus infects plants through wounds in the roots and causes a lot of economic loss of grape and apple trees in California. They examined samples from six orchards across Tulare County in California and found evidence of this fungus in the roots of citrus trees, which had never been reported before. They suggest that this same fungus may be one of the unidentified stresses that make citrus trees more susceptible to dry root rot and that the pervasiveness of this fungus within Californian agricultural land needs to be examined.
