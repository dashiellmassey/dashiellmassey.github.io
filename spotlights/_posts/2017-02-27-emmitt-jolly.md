Dr. Jolly received his bachelor’s degree from Tuskegee University in Alabama, and his master’s and PhD from the University of California — San Francisco. He also completed his postdoctoral fellowship at UCSF. He started studying tropical infectious disease and parasites during this post-doc in Dr. James McKerrow’s lab. He has been at Case Western since 2009.

Varieties of schistosomiasis is found in tropical countries throughout Africa, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and South America. The worm spends part of its lifecycle living within freshwater snails and its larvae are picked up by humans in contaminated rivers. Thus, it largely impacts people living in rural areas. The infection begins as a rash, and develops to include fever, cough, and diarrhea. As the worm larvae mature, they may migrate to the brain or spinal cord, leading to seizures and paralysis.

The complex lifecycle of these worms — spanning multiple hosts and lasting up to 30 years — requires large-scale changes in gene expression. Not only that, but those changes must be well coordinated, so that all of the genes for the snail portion of the life cycle are activated at the same time (for example). Dr. Jolly’s research is focused on identifying transcription factors, proteins that regulate gene expression, and how these factors respond to environmental cues.
