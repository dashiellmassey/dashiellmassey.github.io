Dr. Downes received his undergraduate degree from Johnson C Smith University in Charlotte, NC, and his doctorate from Washington University in St. Louis. He began studying zebrafish in his postdoctoral work at the University of Pennsylvania, and joined the faculty at UMass in 2005.

In his work, Dr. Downes has uncovered some fascinating connections between metabolism and movement. As a way to understand how the spinal cord coordinates movement between the two sides of the body, his lab began examining fish that weren’t coordinating their movement correctly and tracking down which genes had been altered in those individuals.

In one fish, the gene turned out to be a metabolic gene, which encodes an enzyme that breaks down certain amino acids from food. In humans, that gene results in maple syrup urine disease, which often leads to severe brain damage and death. (MSUD is very rare in the general population, but much more prevalent in the Amish and Mennonite populations of Pennsylvania.) This discovery allowed Dr. Downes to create a fish model of MSUD, allowing us to better study this disease. Additionally, very similar metabolic problems have recently been implicated in autism and epilepsy as well.
