headline: This is Dr. Kenneth Olden, PhD, the Founding Dean of the City University of New York School of Public Health. From 1991 to 2005, he served as Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) — the first African-American to head a institute in the NIH.

Dr. Olden earned his bachelor’s degree from Knoxville College, a master’s in genetics from the University of Michigan, and his PhD in cell biology and biochemistry from Temple University. He completed further training at Harvard Medical School and taught there and at Howard University. When he was appointed Director of NIEHS in 1991, he had been serving as the Chairman of Oncology at Howard for six years.

Although he has held largely administrative positions, he has maintained his research interest in glycoproteins, a category of proteins that are modified by attachment of a carbohydrate to them. (Yes, that’s the very exciting world of biochemistry…) He has two research articles (from 1978 and 1985) that are still among the 100 most commonly cited papers. The 1978 paper helped show that adding carbohydrates to a protein allows proteins to function for longer periods of time before they are broken down and recycled. His 1985 paper showed that the commonly-accepted idea that proteins are made by a “conveyer belt” in the cell didn’t make sense.

His interest in glycoproteins led him to collaborate with Dr. Ken Yamada at the National Cancer Institute, in order to study a particular glycoprotein called fibronectin. Fibronectin plays the major role in anchoring cells to their surroundings. Together, they helped to prove that cancer cells make less fibronectin than healthy cells, which may partially explain how metastasis work — if cancer cells stop making fibronectin, then there’s nothing to hold them in place where the tumor has been growing, which would let them float off to some other part of the body and start a new tumor growth. Olden and Yamada were able to use this idea to block metastasis in a mouse model of cancer, although the idea didn’t translate as well to human medicine (yet).

More than anything, Dr. Olden is widely regarded for how much he cares about engaging with people. When he started as director at NIEHS, he implemented regular brown bag lunches where he could get together with his employees and everyone could shoot ideas around in a non-serious environment. Similarly, he created a series of town hall events in order to get the public more involved and more informed about how the environment impacts our health.
