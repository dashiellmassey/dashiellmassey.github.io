Dr. Agbandje-McKenna earned her bachelor’s degree from the University of Hertfordshire and her PhD from the University of London (both in the U.K.) She came to the U.S. in 1989 to pursue postdoctoral research at Purdue University, before returning to the U.K. to work at the University of Warwick. She has been on the faculty at UF since 1999.

Viruses are essentially bundles of nucleic acid (either DNA or RNA) and protein that are capable of infecting cells. Once inside a host cell, the virus uses the host’s DNA replication machinery to reproduce itself, and the host’s RNA transcription machinery to express its genes. Viruses can be roughly divided by their genetic content: some viruses use DNA to encode their genomes, while others use RNA — and either can be single-stranded or double-stranded. Viruses are packaged in a protein coat called the capsid, and some are further packaged in a lipid envelope.

In a recent paper, Dr. Agbandje-McKenna’s lab described atom-level models of a newly-discovered family of viruses, called bufaviruses. The bufaviruses belong to a subset of parvoviruses called protoparvoviruses, which were previously thought to only infect non-human animals. Very little is known about the bufaviruses, which were first discovered in 2012. Two of the three strains were discovered in Burkina Faso, while the third has now been reported in Bhutan, China, Finland, the Netherlands, Thailand, and Turkey. It is thought that the bufaviruses cause diarrhea in infected individuals, although there have not been enough cases yet to say definitively.

The authors isolated the capsid protein VP2 from all three bufavirus subtypes and reconstructed their structures using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), a technique for magnifying very small structures from very thin samples. The electron microscope directs a beam of electrons at the sample, which sits between the electron source and the detector. Thus, the electrons that hit the detector will be a subset of what is emitted from the source, based on the structure and orientation of the sample. (Think of it like you’re capturing the shadow of the sample on darkroom photo paper.) In cryo-EM, the samples are frozen first — which helps to keep them immobilized, allowing for a more accurate image.

The authors found that bufavirus VP2 has a very similar overall structure to other non-human-infecting protoparvoviruses. Intriguingly, however, the looping arm that differed from the other protoparvoviruses was very similar to capsid proteins found in other (less closely related) parvoviruses, which do infect humans! Thus, this looping structure may be important for human-specific infection by these viruses.
