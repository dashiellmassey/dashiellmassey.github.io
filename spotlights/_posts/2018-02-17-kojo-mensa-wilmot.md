Dr. Mensa-Wilmot earned his PhD from the Department of Biological Chemistry at Johns Hopkins University. He has been at the University of Georgia since the early 1990s.

Trypanosomiasis is caused by parasitic infection by the single-celled trypanosome. It is transmitted by the tsetse fly, and gets into the human bloodstream after an insect bite. Infection has two phases — the first is characterized by fever and headaches, while the parasite multiplies within the host. During the second phase, the parasite crosses the blood-brain barrier and infects the central nervous system. In this phase, sleep is highly disturbed, there can be Parkinson’s-like trembling, and in some cases, psychiatric symptoms. Left untreated, trypanosomiasis is fatal, and damage done during the second phase is irreversible. It has been reported across sub-Saharan Africa and close to 70 million people are considered at “high risk”.

Current drugs for trypanosomiasis are toxic and hard to administer, leaving ample room for improvement. Dr. Mensa-Wilmot’s research focuses on screening drug candidates, and a recent paper focused on one such candidate: AEE788. This compound was shown previously to interact with three different signaling proteins in the trypanosome, and Dr. Mensa-Wilmot’s goal was to better understand why this compound had a toxic effect on the parasite. They found that AEE788 blocked the trypanosomes from duplicating themselves, specifically by inhibiting DNA replication.

They suggest that this effect makes AEE788 good for future research on trypanosomes for two reasons. First, it suggests that initiation of DNA replication is related to the proteins that are inhibited by the drug, giving new candidate genes for these processes. (It was previously shown that the proteins that regulate this in many other organisms do not exist/have that function in trypanosomes.) Second, it provides a method for synchronizing parasite cells in the cell cycle: they can add the drug for a few hours, blocking each cell from beginning replication once it reaches that point, and then later wash all the drug away — releasing all of those cells to replicate at the same time. This makes it easier to see how that process works and how consistent it is across cells.
