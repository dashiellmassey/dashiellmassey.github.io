Dr. Olopade was born in Nigeria and earned her MD from the University of Ibadan in 1980. She continued her medical training in Lagos, Cook County Hospital in Chicago, and at the University of Chicago. She has been on the faculty at the University of Chicago since 1991. A year later, she started the Cancer Risk Center at UChicago, which focuses on preventative care for breast cancer (identifying women at higher risk for breast cancer and screening them), and on quality-of-life issues that particularly impact young women diagnosed with breast cancer (e.g. fertility).

Much of Dr. Olopade’s research focuses on two genes called BRCA1 and BRCA2. Every time DNA is replicated and cells divide, some of the DNA gets damaged. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are both involved in the healthy process of repairing those breaks in the DNA, making sure that the DNA gets put back together in the right way. (If it’s repaired incorrectly, it can cause big changes in the DNA that eventually lead to cancer.) These two genes were identified in the early 1990s by studying large families of Jewish women where an abnormally big number of the women developed breast cancer (leading researchers to conclude that there was probably an inherited susceptibility in these families). They found that these women had inherited one defective version of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 (either from their mom or dad) — thus, every cell in their body only had one working copy of the gene. Then at some later point, a cell in their breast tissue had lost its other copy of BRCA1/2, and that cell had gone on to form a tumor.

Although BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are fairly uncommon in the general population (less than 10% of women), a woman who does have one of these mutation has ~80% chance of developing breast cancer by the age of 90. Therefore, genetic testing for mutations in these two genes can help doctors identify a group of high-risk patients.

Dr. Olopade was the first to show that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are also common in African-American populations (remember: it was first identified in Ashkenazi Jewish women) but that these women looked very different clinically. In African-Americans, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are associated with particularly early onset of breast cancer, much more aggressive and drug-resistant cancer, and cancer that starts from a different part of the breast tissue. Additionally, Dr. Olopade found that the cause of BRCA-related cancers was different: African-American women were more likely to lose both copies of functional BRCA during their lifetimes, rather than inheriting one faulty copy and subsequently losing the second. This suggests that there is a gene/environment interaction that affects African-American women differently.
