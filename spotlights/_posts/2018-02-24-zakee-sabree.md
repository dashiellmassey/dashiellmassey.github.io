Dr. Sabree earned his undergraduate degree from Howard University and his PhD in Microbiology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He held two post-doctoral fellowships, first at the University of Arizona and then at Yale. He joined the faculty at OSU in 2012. In 2015, he received a $50,000 grant from the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center.

Symbiotic (mutually beneficial) relationships have been observed between many species and the bacteria that live within them. These relationships often show evidence of long-term co-evolution, which suggests millions of years of symbiosis and has drastic impacts on the genomes of the bacteria. In stink bugs, a clade (evolutionary group) of global agricultural pests, it has been demonstrated that bacteria that live in the gut are transmitted from mother to offspring. When this process has been disrupted, the offspring take longer to develop, behave strangely, and have reduced fertility. These bacteria are also hypothesized to help the stink bugs survive by producing essential nutrients that are not present in bugsâ€™ diet.

In a recent paper, Dr. Sabree and colleagues worked to analyze the genomes of four bacteria, each living within one species of stink bug. Specifically, they isolated DNA from these bacteria and sequenced it, assembling short sequences of DNA back into their best guess of the full DNA sequence of the genome. This allowed them to compare the size of the different genomes (how much DNA? how many genes?) and make hypotheses about their evolutionary history (which bacteria are most closely related to which other ones? how long have these bacteria and bugs been living symbiotically?)

They found that the bacteria had lost much of their DNA compared to related species, but had retained genes that were beneficial to the stink bug. The genes retained were also very similar across the four bacteria species, despite them not being related species, which again is evidence of a very long-term relationship between host and microbe.
