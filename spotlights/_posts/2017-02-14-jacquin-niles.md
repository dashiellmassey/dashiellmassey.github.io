title: Dr. Jacquin Niles
headline: This is Dr. Jacquin Niles, MD PhD, a professor of biological engineering at MIT. His objective is to improve our understanding of how the malaria parasite works, in order to design treatment options that are biologically based — most drugs currently used to treat or prevent malaria seem to work well, but we don’t really understand why.

Dr. Niles studied at MIT as an undergraduate and earned both his MD and PhD through a joint Harvard/MIT program. He headed west to UC Berkeley for a postdoctoral fellowship, before returning in 2007 to MIT to start his lab. His research brings together people with expertise in engineering, chemistry, and microbiology to arrive at cross-disciplinary solutions.

Malaria is a devastating disease, causing about 655,000 deaths per year, mostly in developing countries. (About 40% of the world’s population is at risk.) It is an infectious disease caused by Plasmodium, a group of single-celled parasites. There are five species within the Plasmodium group that can infect humans, but most deaths are caused by Plasmodium falciparum (the others four tend to cause less severe symptoms and people are more likely to recover). The parasite spends part of its life cycle in insects, and part of its lifecycle in humans: when an infected mosquito bites someone, Plasmodium enters the person’s bloodstream and travels to the liver, where it makes many copies of itself and infects red blood cells. Eventually, they cause the red blood cells to burst open, releasing many more parasites that can infect even more red blood cells.

A major goal of the Niles lab is to develop tools for figuring out what Plasmodium genes do functionally. Based on computer models, it is predicted that there are over 5000 genes in Plasmodium falciparum, but we only know what about half of those are doing. Each of those genes with unknown function could potentially be serving a crucial role in the parasite’s survival, but without knowing what it does, we have no idea how to block it from doing its job (or even which one to try to block). Dr. Niles is working to create methods to turn off each of these genes one at a time, in order to see what happens without it. (This is a central concept in genetics, but traditional methods don’t work for many species.)

Another question that Dr. Niles is working on is the question of heme. Heme binds to and carries oxygen, and it is found very abundantly in red blood cells. The malaria parasite also relies on heme for survival. But what’s confusing is that it has a lot of its own machinery for making heme, even though it lives in red blood cells, which are basically just bubbles of heme. (OK, that’s a simplification, but whatever…) Dr. Niles wants to figure out how much the parasite needs to make its own heme, and if blocking that pathway would be a good treatment approach.
