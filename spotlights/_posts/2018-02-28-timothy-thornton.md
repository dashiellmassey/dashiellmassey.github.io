title: Dr. Timothy Thornton
headline: Dr. Timothy Thornton, PhD, Associate Professor of Biostatistics (University of Washington). <p> Dr. Thornton works to develop new statistical methods to analyze the associations between genes and complex traits, particularly in situations complicated by the fact that people in the study are related to one another and/or are of mixed ancestry.

Dr. Thornton studied math at Hampton University, a historically black university in Virginia. He earned his PhD from the University of Chicago from the Statistics department, where his research was focused on new methods for genetic analyses. After leaving Chicago, he was a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley and then at UCSF. He joined the Department of Biostatistics at University of Washington in 2009. Since 2016, he has also been the Robert W. Day Endowed Professor of Public Health at UW.

It is well-recognized that genetics play a role in how different people respond to medications, particularly in cancer patients. On the other hand, we are a long way from having those connections be concrete enough to act on them in the clinical setting. One particularly large limitation is that the majority of studies focus on people of European ancestry, which means we know a lot less about other populations.

In a recent paper, Dr. Thornton and colleagues recruited women being treated for breast cancer at the Alaska Native Medical Center (Anchorage) and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT) Tribal Health Department (NW Montana), who were taking the drug tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is a commonly-used drug in treating estrogen-positive breast cancers. Once taken by the patient, it is activated by interaction with a group of enzymes called CYPs, which turn it into a form that blocks the estrogen receptor. (In estrogen-positive breast cancers, the tumor is relying on signals from estrogen to survive.)

Earlier studies had indicated a relationship between variation in the CYP genes and the effectiveness of tamoxifen treatment, but Dr. Thornton and his collaborators wanted to know if that held true for American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) populations as well. They used DNA samples to find variation in the genes, and simultaneously looked at blood samples to measure how much activated drug was present. They found that which variation of CYP2D6 a woman had was the most useful for predicting the dose she was effectively receiving. They also determined how common the different versions of CYP2D6 were in these two samples.

Based on these results, the authors suggest that clinicians should do genetic testing for these variants in AIAN women prior to treating them with tamoxifen, in order to determine who might benefit from a higher dose or a different medication altogether.
