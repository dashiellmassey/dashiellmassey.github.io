Dr. Melón became interested in the biology of how the brain responds to alcohol as an undergraduate at Middlebury College, where she was a Posse scholar. She earned a Master’s at the State University of New York at Binghamton, and then continued on to a PhD in Addiction Neuroscience from Purdue University. She recently completed a postdoc at Tufts University and joined the faculty at Wesleyan last summer.

Previous research has shown that alcohol affects neurons in a similar way to the neurotransmitter GABA, which is an inhibitory signal in the brain. Both GABA and alcohol can cause loss of coordination and increased anxiety. This research has also shown that the number of GABA receptors, which receive the signal of GABA/alcohol, change in response to binge drinking -- this decrease in the number of GABA receptors is thought to increase alcohol tolerance, which would lead to a feedback loop with higher consumption.

In a recent study, Dr. Melón and colleagues studied mice who were given access to alcohol every few hours for 14 days. (This method was previously well documented to lead to binge drinking in the mice.) They found that binge drinking caused anxiety only in the female mice after 1 day without alcohol. This was associated with an increase in the GABA receptors in one specific type of neurons but no change in other types of neurons.

So they next created mice that didn’t have any of this GABA receptor in that type of neurons. In these mice, males binge-drank a lot more than the normal mice, suggesting that the GABA receptor was somehow limiting how much they drank. Both the males and females without the GABA receptor were less anxious and their movement was less impaired after binge drinking, and they got hyperactive in response to alcohol.

Dr. Melón concluded that the GABA receptors in this type of neuron are important for the development of binge drinking behavior and that they seem to be involved in the balance between the sedative effects of alcohol and the rewarding effects of alcohol. She is interested in continuing to study how and why alcohol affects men and women differently.
