A native of Cameroon, Dr. Kima received his undergraduate degree from the University of Maryland, and a Masters of Science in Public Health from Tulane University. He pursued his doctorate in Molecular Biology and Genetic Engineering at Hahnemann University (now part of Drexel). As a PhD student, Dr. Kima received funding from the Rockefeller Foundation to return to Cameroon to conduct research on protective immune responses to malaria. He graduated with his PhD in 1992 and was a postdoctoral fellow at the medical school at Yale. He came to UF in 2007.

Leishmania is another genus of trypanosome parasites that can infect humans (see Feb 17), and cause a variety of symptoms, depending on the specific species. Leishmania parasites escape the immune system by hiding inside human cells. Specifically, they form a bubble around themselves called a parasitophorous vacuole (PV). A drug called Retro-2 was recently shown to impair the ability of Leishmania parasites to infect human cells: cells treated with the drug contained smaller PVs and each PV contained fewer parasites.

In a recent paper, Dr. Kima and colleagues examined retro-2 and two compounds with similar structure (analogs) that were predicted to work even better, based on their efficiency against a virus. They found that these two analogs were more effective than retro-2: they could actually kill the parasite directly and help the infected cell express appropriate levels of IL-6 (an inflammatory signal that something is wrong). This paper establishes these two retro-2 analogs as attractive candidate drugs for treating Leishmania.
