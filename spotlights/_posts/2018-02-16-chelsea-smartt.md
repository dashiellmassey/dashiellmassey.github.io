Dr. Smartt earned her undergraduate degree from Tennessee State University, and her PhD in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry from UC Irvine in 1995.

The mosquito Ae. aegypti can act as a vector for many human diseases, including chikungunya fever and Zika virus, both of which have been of increasing concern in the past decade. Because there aren’t good medications to give infected individuals, many scientists are focused on controlling the mosquitos to reduce disease risk in human populations. Within the U.S., the environmental conditions in Texas and Florida are the most favorable for this species of mosquito. (The mosquitos studied in Dr. Smartt’s lab were collected from Key West.)

In a recent paper, Dr. Smartt and colleagues tried to better understand the immune response of mosquitos in response to chikungunya and Zika viruses. Specifically, they looked at how much RNA was being made for two defensin genes, which make anti-viral proteins. They found that the mosquitos made more defensins in response to infection with either virus, although the ratio of the two proteins was different depending on which virus was used. They also found that male mosquitos made more anti-viral protein than females, and that this was true at all stages of mosquito development. Finally, they found that there were significant differences in these changes when comparing mosquitos from Orland and Key West.

These results help build a clearer picture of how these genes function in the immune response of the mosquito. The hope is that this information will help us to create genetically-modified mosquitos (which we can then release into the environment) that are more resistant to infection. These mosquitos would thus be less able to spread infection to new human hosts.
