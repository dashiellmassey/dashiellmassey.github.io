title: Dr. John Carpten
headline: This is Dr. John Carpten, PhD, a researcher at the Keck School of Medicine (University of Southern California). In 2016, he was named head of the newly-established Institute of Translational Genomics. His research interests are broad, but all share the same theme of “translational medicine” — a term used to describe projects that combine basic science research with medical applications.

Dr. Carpten earned his PhD from The Ohio State University and completed further training at the National Human Genome Research Institute (part of the NIH). While at NHGRI, he was the lead author on the first paper to look at prostate cancer through a genome-wide lens, scanning the entire genome for variants that were abnormally common or uncommon in men with prostate cancer. By determining which genes had relevant variation, he was able to identify new genes that were important in this disease. He was also the first to look at prostate cancer susceptibility in African-American populations.

Dr. Carpten’s research has focused on developing methods for large-scale genomic research, much of which he has used to study cancer. A recent paper he published looks at how to better identify and confirm rare variants from sequencing datasets. It is generally thought that disease-causing variants in genes will be selected against by evolution, since they give the individual a strong survival disadvantage. Thus, those variants would be expected to be seen at very low frequencies in the population — so we look for rare variants as potentially interesting. However, one problem with looking at super rare events is that you have to worry that what you’re seeing is actually an error in measurement, rather than a real signal. Dr. Carpten’s paper uses complex statistical methods to combine information from multiple variants — i.e. to say, “we believe that these rare variants are legitimate and not errors” — based on those variants affecting the same or related genes.
