Dr. Dennery received her undergraduate degree from McGill University in Montreal and her medical degree from Howard University. She completed her residency at Children’s National Medical Center in Washington DC and trained as a neonatologist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. After completing her training, she was a faculty member at Stanford University for 13 years before being recruited to be the Chair of Pediatrics of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. She moved to Brown in 2015.

Premature infants often have severe lung problems, due to a number of different interacting factors. While these infants are dependent on machines to help them breathe, prolonged use of mechanical ventilation can itself cause lung injury due to oxygen toxicity. Oxygen is transported through the bloodstream by a protein called hemoglobin, made up of a heme molecule and a globin. However, when too much oxygen is present, the hemoglobin will break down and the freed heme molecule is very dangerous to the health of the cell. To protect the cell, it will make a chemical called heme oxygenase (HO), which can break down the heme to get rid of it.

Newborn lungs make a lot of HO, which is thought to help protect them while their lungs finish developing after birth. However, they do not seem to turn “up” production of HO in response to abnormally high levels of oxygen, unlike adult lungs. Dr. Dennery has done work to investigate why that is — and what is regulating the levels of HO in newborn lungs. Specifically, she has shown that a protein called Bach1 regulates HO levels, by blocking the gene that encodes HO from being transcribed into RNA. In a very recent paper, she then looked into why newborn lungs have so much Bach1 relative to other tissues. She identified a micro-RNA (a small piece of RNA that regulates other genes by binding to their RNA transcripts) which normally decreases Bach1 levels, allowing HO to buiild up and do its protective job. However, under conditions of high oxygen, levels of this microRNA are decreased, allowing Bach1 to build up and suppress HO.
